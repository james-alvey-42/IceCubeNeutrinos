{\it The cosmological lower bounds from BBN and CMB on scalar mass need
to be elaborated on. Authors in sect 5.7 have briefly mentioned these bounds
but more emphasis on these bounds in the introduction, in sect 3.3.3 and in
figures is required.}

We have added Section 3.3.3 to deal with these bounds. To make the discussion clearer, we have also moved the original comments in Section 5.7 to this section.

{\it Another key issue is the maximum bound found in Ref.
[40]. This bound needs to be explained more clearly and the conflict with
the value in Table 4.1 should be explained. Ref [40] reports an observational
upper bound of $\sim 10^{46} \, \textrm{erg/s}$ which is consistent with (and weaker than) the
constraint from the cascade emission consideration. Is the value reported in
Table 4.1 an upper bound or a measurement? If it is the latter, then there is
an inconsistency. Relevance of these bounds on the mean free path argument
should be made more clear.}

We have clarified the above points at the end of Section 4.2.1 including amendments to Table 4.1 which should hopefully make the fact that the IceCube value from Ref. [27] is indeed an upper bound on the flux. We also discuss the interpretation of the value in Ref. [40] as suggested.


{\it In addition to the above points, some minor but important changes are
required that I list below.

1) The second sentence of the fourth paragraph of
the introduction (starting with "This is a coincidence" needs to be edited.}

This has been fixed.

{\it 2) The symbol $\psi$ appearing in Eq. (2.1) needs to be defined.}

We have defined it as the SU(2) doublet for the lepton sector after Eq. (2.1).

{\it 3) In the first line of sect 2.2, a reference for the 23\% is required.}

We have updated the value and provided a reference (Ref. [42]).


{\it 4) In sect 3.2, the emphasis on the Majorana nature of $N_i$ is required.}

This has been made clearer at the top of page 5.

{\it 5) Recently it has been shown that for DM mass lighter than few GeV,
the value of annihilation cross section to obtain the right relic abundance is
a bit different from 1 pb so the numerical values in section 3.3.1 should be
updated.}

This value has been updated and a reference provided (Ref. [43]).

{\it 6) After Eq (3.10), there is a discussion of naturalness which is not valid as
the smallness of the splitting compared to the $\delta_i$ masses can be explained by
an approximate lepton number conservation. This argument can be invoked
in sec 5.3, too.}

This has been reflected in the changes at the end of Section 3.3.1.

{\it 7) $A$ and $B$ in sec 3.3.2 should be defined. First sentence in sect 3.3.2 is
misleading and may be interpreted as neutrino decay.}

This has been fixed.

{\it 8) In the first line of page 8, the powers of 2 are redundant.}

The powers of 2 have been removed.

{\it 9) CMB bounds should be added to Sec 3.3.3.}

The bounds have not been added to Section 3.3.3, instead to keep the CMB discussion self-contained, they are given in Table 3.1 in Section 3.3.2.

{\it 10) In the first paragraph of sec 4, the 5th sentence should be modified to
"When a muon neutrino interact with ice via charged current interactions,"}

This has been fixed.

{\it 11) Sect 5.2.1 is confusing and contains contradictory claims about the
ratios of the cross sections. Moreover the interference of the t-channel and
s-channel amplitudes should be discussed.}

Section 5.2.1 has been amended and Section 5.2.3 has been added to deal with the interference term between the s-channel and t-channel amplitudes.

{\it 12) The argument in the line after Eq (5.14) is not convincing.}

The argument has been extended after Eq. (5.14).

{\it 13) In sec 5.5, instead of simultaneous, it is better to write the same.}

This has been fixed.

{\it 14) In the first paragraph of sect 5.7, the following phrases need to be
edited "to see the separate the constraint" and "different to" $\rightarrow$ "different
from".}

This has been fixed.

{\it 15) In the last sentence of sect 5.8, the authors should replace "mean
free path" with "optical depth" because "mean free path" is a local concept
inversely proportional to the number density.}

This has been fixed.

{\it 16) In the figures, the line marked with "K + decay" is in fact Eq (3.9).
The horizontal line comes from "K + decay".}

The plots have been updated to reflect this.

{\it 17) The format that the references appear looks non-standard.}

The references have been updated to reflect this.

{\it With kind regards,
The referee}
