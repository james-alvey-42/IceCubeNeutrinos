abstract = {We discuss how to constrain new physics in the neutrino sector using multimessenger astronomical observations by the IceCube experiment. The information from time and direction coincidence with an identifiable source is used to improve experimental limits by constraining the mean free path of neutrinos from these sources. Over the coming years, IceCube is expected to detect neutrinos from a variety of neutrino-producing sources, and has already identified the Blazar TXS 0506+056 as a neutrino-producing source. We explore specific phenomenological models: additional neutrino interactions, neutrinophilic dark matter, and lepton-number-charged axion dark matter. For each new physics scenario, we interpret the observation of neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 as a constraint on the parameters of the new physics models. We also discuss mergers involving neutron stars and black holes, and how the detection of neutrinos coincident with these events could place bounds on the new physics models.},

abstract = {We show that the new measurement of the effective number of neutrinos (N eff) by the Planck satellite can be used to set a robust lower bound on the mass of cold thermal dark matter of O(MeV). Our limit applies if the dark matter remains in thermal equilibrium by coupling to electrons and photons or through interactions with neutrinos, and applies regardless of whether the dark matter annihilation cross-section is s-wave or p-wave. To illustrate our bounds we apply them to a model of a supersymmetric neutralino annihilating to neutrinos, via a light mixed left-right handed sneutrino mediator. While this scenario was not constrained by previous data, the Planck limits on N eff allow us to set a lower bound on the neutralino dark matter mass of 3.5 MeV.},

abstract = {The possibility that the dark matter comprises primordial black holes (PBHs) is considered, with particular emphasis on the currently allowed mass windows at 10 16-10 17 g, 10 20-10 24 g and 1-10 3 M. The Planck mass relics of smaller evaporating PBHs are also considered. All relevant constraints (lensing, dynamical, large-scale structure and accretion) are reviewed and various effects necessary for a precise calculation of the PBH abundance (non-Gaussianity, non-sphericity, critical collapse and merging) are accounted for. It is difficult to put all the dark matter in PBHs if their mass function is monochromatic but this is still possible if the mass function is extended, as expected in many scenarios. A novel procedure for confronting observational constraints with an extended PBH mass spectrum is therefore introduced. This applies for arbitrary constraints and a wide range of PBH formation models, and allows us to identify which model-independent conclusions can be drawn from constraints over all mass ranges. We focus particularly on PBHs generated by inflation, pointing out which effects in the formation process influence the mapping from the inflationary power spectrum to the PBH mass function. We then apply our scheme to two specific inflationary models in which PBHs provide the dark matter. The possibility that the dark matter is in intermediate-mass PBHs of 1-10 3 M is of special interest in view of the recent detection of black-hole mergers by LIGO. The possibility of Planck relics is also intriguing but virtually untestable.},

We identify three different categories of neutrino mass generation: (1) finite irreducible diagrams; (2) finite extensions of the usual seesaw mechanisms at one-loop and (3) divergent loop realizations of the seesaws. All radiative one-loop neutrino mass models must fall into one of these classes. Case (1) gives the leading contribution to neutrino mass naturally and a classic example of this class is the Zee model. We demonstrate that in order to prevent that a tree level contribution dominates in case (2), Majorana fermions running in the loop and an additional Z 2 symmetry are needed for a genuinely leading one-loop contribution. In the type-II loop extensions, the Yukawa coupling will be generated at one loop, whereas the type-I/III extensions can be interpreted as loop-induced inverse or linear seesaw mechanisms. For the divergent diagrams in category (3), the tree level contribution cannot be avoided and is in fact needed as counter term to absorb the divergence.},

This scenario can be realized for both real and complex SLIM. Simultaneously explaining the neutrino mass and dark matter abundance constrains the scenario.

The low energy scenario can be embedded within various SU(2) ×U(1) symmetric models.

abstract = {Despite being very successful in explaining the wide range of precision experimental results obtained so far, the Standard Model (SM) of elementary particles fails to address two of the greatest observations of the recent decades: tiny but nonzero neutrino masses and the well-known problem of missing mass in the Universe. Typically the new models beyond the SM explain only one of these observations. Instead, in the present article, we take the view that they both point towards the same new extension of the Standard Model. The new particles introduced are responsible simultaneously for neutrino masses and for the dark matter of the Universe. The stability of dark matter and the smallness of neutrino masses are guaranteed by a U(1) global symmetry, broken to a remnant Z{\_}2. The canonical seesaw mechanism is forbidden and neutrino masses emerge at the loop level being further suppressed by the small explicit breaking of the U(1) symmetry. The new particles and interactions are invoked at the electroweak scale and lead to rich phenomenology in colliders, in lepton flavour violating rare decays and in direct and indirect dark matter searches, making the model testable in the coming future.},

abstract = {The annihilation of new dark matter candidates with masses mX in the MeV range may account for the galactic positrons that are required to explain the 511 keV $\gamma$-ray flux from the galactic bulge. We study the impact of MeV-mass thermal relic particles on the primordial synthesis of 2 H, 4 He, and 7 Li. If the new particles are in thermal equilibrium with neutrinos during the nucleosynthesis epoch they increase the helium mass fraction for mX {\textless} ∼ 10 MeV and are thus disfavored. If they couple primarily to the electromagnetic plasma they can have the opposite effect of lowering both helium and deuterium. For mX = 4-10 MeV they can even improve the overall agreement between the predicted and observed 2 H and 4 He abundances.},

abstract = {Weakly Interacting Massive Particles are often said to be the best Dark Matter candidates. Studies have shown that large Dark Matter-photon or Dark Matter-baryon interactions could be allowed by cosmology. Here we address the question of the role of the Dark Matter interactions in more detail to determine at which extent Dark Matter has to be necessarily weakly interacting. To this purpose, we compute the collisional damping (and free-streaming) scales of generic interacting Dark Matter candidates and investigate the effects on structure formation. Our calculations are valid provided the Dark Matter particles have experienced a phase of statistical equilibrium at some stage during their evolution. By comparing these damping lengths to the scale of the smallest primordial structures known to exist in the Universe, we obtain necessary conditions that any candidate must satisfy. These conditions are expressed in terms of the Dark Matter particles' mass and either the total Dark Matter interaction rate or the interaction rate of Dark Matter with a specific species. The case of Dark Matter interacting with neutrinos or photons is considered in full detail. Our results are valid even for energy dependent cross-sections and for any possible initial fluctuations spectrum. We point out the existence of new Dark Matter scenarios and exhibit new damping regimes. For example, an interacting candidate may bear a similar damping than that of collisionless Warm Dark Matter particles. The main difference is due to the Dark Matter coupling to interacting (or even freely-propagating) species. Our approach yields a general classification of Dark Matter candidates which extends the definitions of the usual Cold, Warm and Hot Dark Matter scenarios when interactions, weak or strong, are considered.},

@techreport{Davidson2002,
abstract = {In the seesaw model, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe can be generated by the decay of the lightest right-handed neutrino, $\nu$ R. For a hierarchical spectrum of right-handed neutrinos, we show that there is a model independent upper bound on the CP asymmetry produced in these decays: ǫ {\textless} 3 m $\nu$3 M $\nu$R /(8$\pi$H u 2). This implies that ǫ and the mass M $\nu$R of the lightest right-handed neutrino are not independent parameters, as is commonly assumed. If m $\nu$3 = ∆m 2 atm and the $\nu$ R are produced thermally, then leptogenesis requires a reheat temperature of the Universe T reh {\textgreater} M $\nu$R {\textgreater} 10 8 GeV. Reasonable estimates of $\nu$ R production and the subsequent washout of the asymmetry, as made by Buchm{\"{u}}ller and Pl{\"{u}}macher, imply M $\nu$R {\textgreater}},

abstract = {If there is no new physics beyond the TeV energy scale, such as in a theory of large extra dimensions, the smallness of the seesaw neutrino mass, i.e. m $\nu$ = m 2 D /m N , cannot be explained by a very large m N. In contrast to previous attempts to find an alternative mechanism for a small m $\nu$ , I show how a solution may be obtained in a simple extension of the Standard Model, without using any ingredient supplied by the large extra dimensions. It is also experimentally testable at future accelerators.},

abstract = {In the minimal standard electroweak gauge model, there is an effective dimension-five operator which generates neutrino masses, and it has only three tree-level realiza-tions. One is the canonical seesaw mechanism with a right-handed neutrino. Another is having a heavy Higgs triplet as recently proposed. The third is to have a heavy Majorana fermion triplet, an example of which is presented here in the context of su-persymmetric SU (5) grand unification. The three generic one-loop realizations of this operator are also discussed.},
