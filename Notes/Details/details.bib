abstract = {We study the gravitational clustering of big bang relic neutrinos onto existing cold dark matter (CDM) and baryonic structures within the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, using both numerical simulations and a semi-analytical linear technique, with the aim of understanding the neutrinos' clustering properties for direct detection purposes. In a comparative analysis, we find that the linear technique systematically underestimates the amount of clustering for a wide range of CDM halo and neutrino masses. This invalidates earlier claims of the technique's applicability. We then compute the approximate phase space distribution of relic neutrinos in our neighbourhood at Earth, and estimate the large scale neutrino density contrasts within the local Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin zone. With these findings, we discuss the implications of gravitational neutrino clustering for scattering-based detection methods, ranging from flux detection via Cavendish-type torsion balances, to target detection using accelerator beams and cosmic rays. For emission spectroscopy via resonant annihilation of extremely energetic cosmic neutrinos on the relic neutrino background, we give new estimates for the expected enhancement in the event rates in the direction of the Virgo cluster.},

abstract = {We present the dissection in space, time, and energy of the region around the IceCube-170922A neutrino alert. This study is motivated by: (1) the first association between a neutrino alert and a blazar in a flaring state, TXS 0506+056; (2) the evidence of a neutrino flaring activity during 2014-2015 from the same direction; (3) the lack of an accompanying simultaneous $\gamma$-ray enhancement from the same counterpart; (4) the contrasting flaring activity of a neighbouring bright $\gamma$-ray source, the blazar PKS 0502+049, during 2014-2015. Our study makes use of multi-wavelength archival data accessed through Open Universe tools and includes a new analysis of Fermi-LAT data. We find that PKS 0502+049 contaminates the $\gamma$-ray emission region at low energies but TXS 0506+056 dominates the sky above a few GeV. TXS 0506+056, which is a very strong (top percent) radio and $\gamma$-ray source, is in a high $\gamma$-ray state during the neutrino alert but in a low though hard $\gamma$-ray state in coincidence with the neutrino flare. Both states can be reconciled with the energy associated with the neutrino emission and, in particular during the low/hard state, there is evidence that TXS 0506+056 has undergone a hadronic flare with very important implications for blazar modelling. All multi-messenger diagnostics reported here support a single coherent picture in which TXS 0506+056, a very high energy $\gamma$-ray blazar, is the only counterpart of all the neutrino emissions in the region and therefore the most plausible first non-stellar neutrino and, hence, cosmic ray source.},

abstract = {We discuss how to constrain new physics in the neutrino sector using multimessenger astronomical observations by the IceCube experiment. The information from time and direction coincidence with an identifiable source is used to improve experimental limits by constraining the mean free path of neutrinos from these sources. Over the coming years, IceCube is expected to detect neutrinos from a variety of neutrino-producing sources, and has already identified the Blazar TXS 0506+056 as a neutrino-producing source. We explore specific phenomenological models: additional neutrino interactions, neutrinophilic dark matter, and lepton-number-charged axion dark matter. For each new physics scenario, we interpret the observation of neutrinos from TXS 0506+056 as a constraint on the parameters of the new physics models. We also discuss mergers involving neutron stars and black holes, and how the detection of neutrinos coincident with these events could place bounds on the new physics models.},

abstract = {When combining cosmological and oscillations results to constrain the neutrino sector, the question of the propagation of systematic uncertainties is often raised. We address this issue in the context of the derivation of an upper bound on the sum of the neutrino masses ($\Sigma$m$\nu$) with recent cosmological data. This work is performed within the $\Lambda$CDM model extended to $\Sigma$m$\nu$ , for which we advocate the use of three mass-degenerate neutrinos. We focus on the study of systematic uncertainties linked to the foregrounds modelling in CMB data analysis, and on the impact of the present knowledge of the reionisation optical depth. This is done through the use of different likelihoods built from Planck data. Limits on $\Sigma$m$\nu$ are derived with various combinations of data, including the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) results. We also discuss the impact of the preference for current CMB data for amplitudes of the gravitational lensing distortions higher than expected within the $\Lambda$CDM model, and add the Planck CMB lensing. We then derive a robust upper limit: $\Sigma$m$\nu$ {\textless} 0.17 eV at 95{\%} CL, including 0.01 eV of foreground systematics. We also discuss the neutrino mass repartition and show that today's data do not allow one to disentangle normal from inverted hierarchy. The impact on the other cosmological parameters is also reported, for different assumptions on the neutrino mass repartition, and different high and low multipole CMB likelihoods.},

abstract = {In this topical review we argue that neutrino mass and mixing data motivates extending the Standard Model to include a non-Abelian discrete flavour symmetry in order to accurately predict the large leptonic mixing angles and CP violation. We begin with an overview of the Standard Model puzzles, followed by a description of some classic lepton mixing patterns. Lepton mixing may be regarded as a deviation from tri-bimaximal mixing, with charged lepton corrections leading to solar mixing sum rules, or tri-maximal lepton mixing leading to atmospheric mixing rules. We survey neutrino mass models, using a roadmap based on the open questions in neutrino physics. We then focus on the seesaw mechanism with right-handed neutrinos, where sequential dominance (SD) can account for large lepton mixing angles and CP violation, with precise predictions emerging from constrained SD (CSD). We define the flavour problem and discuss progress towards a theory of favour using GUTs and discrete family symmetry. We classify models as direct, semidirect or indirect, according to the relation between the Klein symmetry of the mass matrices and the discrete family symmetry, in all cases focussing on spontaneous CP violation. Finally we give two examples of realistic and highly predictive indirect models with CSD, namely an A to Z of flavour with Pati-Salam and a fairly complete A 4 Ã— SU (5) SUSY GUT of flavour, where both models have interesting implications for leptogenesis.},

abstract = {Individual astrophysical sources previously detected in neutrinos are limited to the Sun and the supernova 1987A, whereas the origins of the diffuse flux of high-energy cosmic neutrinos remain unidentified. On 22 September 2017 we detected a high-energy neutrino, IceCube-170922A, with an energy of approximately 290 TeV. Its arrival direction was consistent with the location of a known gamma-ray blazar TXS 0506+056, observed to be in a flaring state. An extensive multi-wavelength campaign followed, ranging from radio frequencies to gamma-rays. These observations characterize the variability and energetics of the blazar and include the first detection of TXS 0506+056 in very-high-energy gamma-rays. This observation of a neutrino in spatial coincidence with a gamma-ray emitting blazar during an active phase suggests that blazars may be a source of high-energy neutrinos.},

abstract = {The excess of neutrino candidate events detected by IceCube from the direction of TXS 0506+056 has generated a great deal of interest in blazars as sources of high-energy neutrinos. In this study, we analyze the publicly available portion of the IceCube dataset, performing searches for neutrino point sources in spatial coincidence with the blazars and other active galactic nuclei contained in the Fermi 3LAC and the Roma BZCAT catalogs, as well as in spatial and temporal coincidence with flaring sources identified in the Fermi Collab-oration's All-Sky Variability Analysis (FAVA). We find no evidence that blazars generate a significant flux of high-energy neutrinos, and conclude that no more than 5-15{\%} of the diffuse flux measured by IceCube can originate from this class of objects. While we cannot rule out the possibility that TXS 0506+056 has at times generated significant neutrino emission, we find that such behavior cannot be common among blazars, requiring TXS 0506+056 to be a rather extreme outlier and not representative of the overall blazar population. The bulk of the diffuse high-energy neutrino flux must instead be generated by a significantly larger population of less-luminous sources, such as non-blazar active galactic nuclei.},
